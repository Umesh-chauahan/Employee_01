# Employee Management System (MERN Stack)

A simple **Employee Management System** built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and **Vite** for the frontend setup. This application allows you to manage employee data such as name, position, department, and salary.

## Features

- **Add Employees**: Add new employee details to the system.
- **View Employees**: List all employees in the system.
- **Delete Employees**: Delete an employee from the system.
- **Responsive Design**: The frontend is built to be responsive for better user experience on different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB
  - Mongoose (for MongoDB object modeling)
  
- **Frontend**:
  - React
  - Vite (Fast development build tool)
  
- **Other**:
  - Axios (for API requests)
  - dotenv (for environment variables)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - NoSQL database (or use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) for cloud hosting)

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee-management-system.git
Navigate to the backend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd employee-management-system/backend
Install the backend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Create a .env file in the backend directory and add the MongoDB URI:

env
Copy code
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/employeeDB
If using MongoDB Atlas, the URI will be provided to you after setting up an Atlas cluster.

Run the backend server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The server will run on http://localhost:5000.
